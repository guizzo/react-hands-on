## About this repo

As with all technologies, there would be much to say and explore, but today we will focus on the core aspects of the library, in order to allow you to be operational as quickly as possible.

For the occasion I thought of preparing this repository; inside you will find an example application, very simple, which however highlights some of the peculiarities of the library, such as for example the management of the state of the components, the input props, the event handlers and an example of an http call to an external resource.

React clearly has much more to offer, but considering the time available for this session, I therefore preferred to focus on the aspects that I think are fundamental for working with this library nowadays.
